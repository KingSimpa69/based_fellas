            <p>Welcome to the home of the Based Fellas. 
                We&apos;re a 10k generative pfp NFT art collection that made history by launching on Ethereum&apos;s Layer 2, Base. 
                After the initial launch, the project&apos;s developer handed over control to trusted community members. 
                Together, we blend art and community spirit, fresh ideas and knowledge of Web3 development. 
                If you like the art, own a Based Fellow, join our community, and come along for the exciting ride as we explore web3 possibilities.</p>
